        It is our hope that all the projects in the lab culminate in two major ways: the first, is a better understanding of brain and 
        breast cancer, and the second is the development of imaging methods that facilitate a physician’s prognosis. Just as one undergoes 
        a blood test to identify pathogens, undergoing ‘imaging tests’ can provide ‘biomarkers’ to inform the physician’s prognosis. 
        To do this, one needs a detailed understanding of cancer and the engineering principles underlying image formation. In the Pathak 
        Lab we employ biomedical engineering approaches to straddle these disciplines. We hope that addressing these issues will profoundly 
        affect patient outcome and disease management.
