        <b><u>Research Statement</u></b>
        <div align="justify">
          For years, researchers have focused on the role of the cancer cell in disease progression. However, the cancer cell's immediate environment, i.e. the surrounding normal cells and associated tissues also play an important role in tumor development.
          The Pathak Lab characterizes the changes that occur in this ‘tumor microenvironment’ using novel biomedical imaging techniques. To advance our understanding of cancer, our research focuses on the following key areas: (i) contrast mechanisms; (ii) multiscale imaging; (iii) data visualization; (iv) clinical biomarkers and (v) biophysical modeling.

          My approach to mentoring and science is summed up by the following quotes:
