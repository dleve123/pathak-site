        We have organized a very exciting and affordable Cancer Imaging workshop to be held in beautiful Austin this fall.
        So please encourage your students/post-docs/faculty to attend so that they can learn about the very latest in pre-clinical
        and clinical cancer imaging.

        Heartiest congratulations to both Stacy Gil and Meghana Kalavar
        for being awarded the Provost's Undergraduate Research Award for 2014.
        Stacy is going to develop an educational tool for teaching students about
        the neurovasculature and Meghana is going to use multiphoton microscopy to study
        neurovascular decoupling in disease. We are very proud of you both!

        The Pathak Lab's new article on 'Multiscale and Multimodal Imaging of
        Angiogenesis in Breast Cancer' has been featured on the cover of
        the July issue of Angiogenesis. This is the first report describing the integration
        of multiple imaging methods to examine blood vessel remodeling during breast
        cancer progression. Fantastic job Jana Cebulla, Eugene Kim and Jiangyang Zhang!

        The Pathak Lab's new article in collaboration with Dr. Popel's Systems Biology Lab
        on simulating blood flow in breast cancer based on imaging data has been featured on
        the cover of Microvascular Research. This is going to be the journal's cover for the
        entire year! This is a huge honor so congrats all and special thanks to Spyros Stamatelos
